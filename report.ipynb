    "\n",
    "The objective of the CPS is (1) to identify the hand shapes being presented by each player for stage one and (2) to determine the optimal action to win the game through a game-theoretical analysis. The workflow consists of three major components: **hand detection and classification**, **enumeration of all possible outcomes**, and **strategy selection**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The system first detects up to four hands simultaneously and classifies each as *Rock*, *Paper*, or *Scissors*. From these detected shapes, all feasible hand-combinations are computed using Cartesian enumeration. A payoff analysis is then applied to determine which move Player 1 should remove in Stage Two to minimize expected loss and maximize strategic advantage. This modular structure isolates perception from decision-making, allowing both components to be improved independently.\n",

    "3. **Custom YOLOv11 Gesture Detector** – trained specifically on RPS gestures for real-time accuracy.\n",

    "YOLOv11 was chosen due to high-speed multi-object detection and domain-specific fine-tuning through:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Image annotation via custom scripts,\n",
    "- Automatic label generation and dataset structuring,\n",
    "- Controlled training of a YOLOv11 backbone for 80 epochs.\n",

    "In our implementation, we selected **YOLOv11** because it proved to be the most robust model for identifying and labeling up to four hands in a single frame. To make YOLOv11 suitable for our RPS-1 application, we trained it on numerous hand-gesture images consisting of the three target classes: **Rock**, **Paper**, and **Scissors**. Due to the similarity in publicly available datasets on Kaggle, three datasets were merged to reduce the chance of overfitting and increase generalizability.\n",
    "\n",
    "To account for variations in image formats, `imageannotation.py` automatically handles JPG, JPEG, and PNG files. A pretrained YOLOv11 model is used to localize the hand in each image and draw a bounding box around it. These bounding boxes provide clear supervision signals during training, ensuring the model focuses on the gesture-performing region.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following annotation, `datasplit.py` divides the dataset into an **80% training** and **20% validation** split, randomly shuffling samples before placement into new directories. Because YOLOv11 requires a YAML configuration file, `datasplit.py` generates this file automatically for training via `rps_model.py`.\n",

    "The training pipeline uses a pretrained YOLOv11s model as its foundation. Starting from a pretrained backbone significantly accelerates convergence because the model already understands general visual patterns such as edges, shapes, and textures. This allows the network to focus on learning the distinctions between the three gesture classes, even with a limited dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "A dataset YAML file defines the training and validation directories as well as the class labels. During the training process, YOLOv11 automatically handles dataloading, batch creation, and optimization, while continuously monitoring performance metrics such as Loss, Precision, Recall, and mean Average Precision (mAP).\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Data Augmentation Strategy**\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure that the model generalizes well to real-world camera conditions, a comprehensive augmentation pipeline is applied during training. These augmentations include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **HSV colour variation** to simulate different lighting environments  \n",
    "- **Rotations, translations, scaling, and shearing** to vary the spatial relationships of the hands  \n",
    "- **Perspective distortion** to represent off-angle camera viewpoints  \n",
    "- **Horizontal and vertical flips** to account for mirrored gestures  \n",
    "- **Mosaic augmentation** to expose the model to multiple contexts simultaneously  \n",
    "- **MixUp blending** to regularize decision boundaries  \n",
    "\n",
    "This augmentation strategy minimizes overfitting and enhances robustness against noise, motion, and inconsistent hand positioning. Furthermore, the use of mosic augmentation specifically allows the model to learn from images containing more than one hand which is important to consider given the task at hand and the limitations of the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Hyperparameter Configuration**\n",
    "\n",
    "Training is performed for 80 epochs at a resolution of 640×640 with a batch size of 16. A cosine learning-rate scheduler is used to smooth the convergence behaviour over time, and early stopping is enabled to prevent unnecessary computation if validation performance plateaus. These hyperparameters offer a practical balance between training speed and detection accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Model Export and Integration**\n",
    "\n",
    "Upon completion of training, YOLOv11 automatically exports the best checkpoint—based on validation results—into a dedicated project folder. This exported weight file becomes the inference model used in the real-time hand-detection system of the CPS. By integrating this optimized model into the perception pipeline, the system achieves:\n",

    "- Fast and accurate gesture detection  \n",
    "- Reliable multi-hand tracking  \n",
    "- Robust performance in general indoor lighting  \n",
    "- Smooth interaction with the downstream decision-making engine  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Significance to the CPS Project**\n",
    "\n",
    "The YOLOv11 training pipeline is an essential component of the RPS-1 system. It transforms raw video input into symbolic gesture predictions, enabling the game decision engine to operate on high-confidence inputs. The pipeline demonstrates how modern computer-vision models can be tailored effectively to domain-specific tasks, even with mixed datasets and limited hardware resources.\n",

    "The weighted-strategy framework is mathematically equivalent to computing a Nash equilibrium on a modified payoff matrix, where each entry has been reweighted according to the predicted behavior of the opponent. By incorporating different valuations for wins, losses, and draws—conditioned on whether the opponent’s move aligns with the anticipated action—the model effectively reshapes the underlying incentive structure of the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "These adjustments alter the strategic landscape by amplifying or diminishing the relative desirability of particular actions, thereby shifting the equilibrium toward either more aggressive or more conservative mixed strategies. As a result, the weighted model provides a principled mechanism for integrating behavioural forecasts directly into equilibrium analysis while preserving the core mathematical structure of the game.\n",
