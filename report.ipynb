    "Cyber-physical systems (CPS) consist of three entities, sensing, computing, and actuating working together to enable real-time processing and response.

    "The more commonly known variant Rock-Paper-Scissors (RPS) offers a simple pairwise competition between two players. The “Minus-One” (RPS-1) variant introduces complexity to this decision space by introducing one additional hand per player. Players must present both of their hands and then remove one, with the remaining pair being the decider. This addition makes the game a two-stage, simultaneous, zero-sum game.  \n",

    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of the CPS is (1) to identify the hand shapes being presented by each player for stage one and (2) to determine the optimal action to win the game through a game-theoretical analysis. The workflow consists of three major components: **hand detection and classification**, **enumeration of all possible outcomes**, and **strategy selection**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The system first detects up to four hands simultaneously and classifies each as *Rock*, *Paper*, or *Scissors*. From these detected shapes, all feasible hand-combinations are computed using Cartesian enumeration. A payoff analysis is then applied to determine which move Player 1 should remove in Stage Two to minimize expected loss and maximize strategic advantage. This modular structure isolates perception from decision-making, allowing both components to be improved independently.\n",

    "To formally evaluate Stage-Two interactions, each player is restricted to a **two-move subset** of  \n",

    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "RP,\\quad RS,\\quad PS.\n",

    "### **Interpretation of Equilibria**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1. Symmetric subsets ⇒ symmetric equilibria**\n",
    "\n",
    "When the subset pairings are identical (e.g., $RP$ vs. $RP$ or $PS$ vs. $PS$), no player holds a structural advantage.  \n",
    "Both players mix uniformly:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "p^* = q^* = \\tfrac{1}{2}.\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "These cases represent balanced strategic interactions with no dominant action.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2. Asymmetric subsets create predictable advantages**\n",
    "\n",
    "In pairings where the two-move subsets differ, one player typically holds a structural advantage based on which of their moves counters the weaker option in the opponent’s set.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in $(RP, PS)$:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Player 2’s **Paper** is the strongest available move  \n",
    "- Player 1’s best response is **Rock**\n",
    "\n",
    "The equilibrium reflects this:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "p^* = \\tfrac{1}{3}, \\qquad q^* = \\tfrac{2}{3}.\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, Player 1 is most likely to play **Rock**, while Player 2 is most likely to play **Paper**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **3. Most-likely moves follow threat coverage**\n",
    "\n",
    "Across all asymmetric games:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The most likely move for each player is the one that **covers** more of the opponent's vulnerabilities.  \n",
    "- Equilibrium probabilities reflect how “safe” each move is against the opposing subset.\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis forms the theoretical basis for the loss-minimization logic used in the CPS and provides users with insight into which move introduces the highest strategic risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The **mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium** for this matrix is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "q^* = \\frac{d - b}{a - b - c + d}, \n",
    "\\qquad\n",
    "p^* = \\frac{d - c}{a - b - c + d},\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $p^*$ and $q^*$ indicate the equilibrium probability of selecting the first move in each subset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Computing these values across all nine subset pairings reveals the most strategically stable mixture for both players. Symmetric pairings produce uniform mixing, while asymmetric subsets exhibit predictable dominance patterns based on threat coverage. These results form the basis of risk evaluation and inform the user on which move presents the highest loss potential.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **User-Driven Strategy Selection**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the final CPS implementation, the decision of which move to remove for Stage Two is made **by the user**, not automatically by the system. Rather than enforcing an optimal strategy, the CPS presents users with the computed outcome enumeration, payoff structure, and equilibrium insights, allowing them to select their preferred strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "This design transforms the CPS into a **decision-support tool**, where system analysis guides but does not control user action. It increases user agency, introduces natural variability into game outcomes, and mirrors human-in-the-loop operation common in real cyber-physical systems. Additionally, this approach promotes engagement with fundamental game-theoretical concepts—including expected value and equilibrium—while maintaining a transparent and interpretable model.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Connection to the Weighted Strategy Model**\n",
    "\n",
    "The system incorporates a weighted-strategy framework in which each payoff $U(m_i,n_j)$ is transformed into a behaviorally informed payoff $U'(m_i,n_j)$. These weights adjust the incentive structure when the predicted opponent move is played, generating a modified payoff matrix:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "\\begin{array}{c|cc}\n",
    " & X & Y \\\\\\hline\n",
    "A & a' & b' \\\\\n",
    "B & c' & d'\n",
    "\\end{array}\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "Applying the same Nash formulas to this reweighted matrix:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "q^* = \\frac{d' - b'}{a' - b' - c' + d'},\n",
    "\\qquad\n",
    "p^* = \\frac{d' - c'}{a' - b' - c' + d'},\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "allows the system to integrate behavioral forecasting while preserving theoretical consistency. This ensures that the decision-support engine can adapt to user-selected strategies without altering the underlying equilibrium structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Hand Detection and Gesture Classification**\n",
    "\n",
    "Three gesture-recognition approaches were evaluated:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Mediapipe Landmark Classifier** — rule-based, lightweight, no training required; rejected due to poor generalization.  \n",
    "2. **Mediapipe Gesture Recognition Model** — rejected for instability under real-world lighting and gesture overlap.  \n",
    "3. **Custom YOLOv11 Gesture Detector** — selected for its accuracy, speed, and robustness.\n",
    "\n",
    "Model training involved automated annotation, dataset restructuring, and fine-tuning a YOLOv11 backbone for 80 epochs with task-appropriate augmentations. The resulting detector outputs symbolic labels suitable for strategic evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Player Segmentation Logic**\n",
    "\n",
    "Player assignment is achieved through spatial partitioning of the camera frame:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Left half → Player 1  \n",
    "- Right half → Player 2  \n",
    "\n",
    "This method reliably maps detected gestures to the correct player under a fixed camera layout.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **System Integration**\n",
    "\n",
    "The CPS integrates **perception**, **classification**, **subset enumeration**, and **game-theoretical evaluation** into a real-time decision-support pipeline. Detected gestures are fed into the strategy framework, which computes:\n",

    "In our implementation, we selected **YOLOv11** because it proved to be the most robust model for identifying and labeling up to four hands in a single frame. To make YOLOv11 suitable for our RPS-1 application, we trained it on numerous hand-gesture images consisting of the three target classes: **Rock**, **Paper**, and **Scissors**. Due to the similarity in publicly available datasets on Kaggle, three datasets were merged to reduce the chance of overfitting and increase generalizability.\n",
    "\n",
    "To account for variations in image formats, `imageannotation.py` automatically handles JPG, JPEG, and PNG files. A pretrained YOLOv11 model is used to localize the hand in each image and draw a bounding box around it. These bounding boxes provide clear supervision signals during training, ensuring the model focuses on the gesture-performing region.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following annotation, `datasplit.py` divides the dataset into an **80% training** and **20% validation** split, randomly shuffling samples before placement into new directories.

Starting from a pretrained backbone significantly accelerates convergence because the model already understands general visual patterns such as edges, shapes, and textures. This allows the network to focus on learning the distinctions between the three gesture classes, even with a limited dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "A dataset YAML file defines the training and validation directories as well as the class labels. During the training process, YOLOv11 automatically handles dataloading, batch creation, and optimization, while continuously monitoring performance metrics such as Loss, Precision, Recall, and mean Average Precision (mAP).\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Data Augmentation Strategy**\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure that the model generalizes well to real-world camera conditions, a comprehensive augmentation pipeline is applied during training. These augmentations include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **HSV colour variation** to simulate different lighting environments  \n",
    "- **Rotations, translations, scaling, and shearing** to vary the spatial relationships of the hands  \n",
    "- **Perspective distortion** to represent off-angle camera viewpoints  \n",
    "- **Horizontal and vertical flips** to account for mirrored gestures  \n",
    "- **Mosaic augmentation** to expose the model to multiple contexts simultaneously  \n",
    "- **MixUp blending** to regularize decision boundaries  \n",
    "\n",
    "This augmentation strategy minimizes overfitting and enhances robustness against noise, motion, and inconsistent hand positioning. Furthermore, the use of mosic augmentation specifically allows the model to learn from images containing more than one hand which is important to consider given the task at hand and the limitations of the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Hyperparameter Configuration**\n",
    "\n",
    "Training is performed for 80 epochs at a resolution of 640×640 with a batch size of 16. A cosine learning-rate scheduler is used to smooth the convergence behaviour over time, and early stopping is enabled to prevent unnecessary computation if validation performance plateaus. These hyperparameters offer a practical balance between training speed and detection accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Model Export and Integration**\n",
    "\n",
    "Upon completion of training, YOLOv11 automatically exports the best checkpoint—based on validation results—into a dedicated project folder. This exported weight file becomes the inference model used in the real-time hand-detection system of the CPS. By integrating this optimized model into the perception pipeline, the system achieves:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Fast and accurate gesture detection  \n",
    "- Reliable multi-hand tracking  \n",
    "- Robust performance in general indoor lighting  \n",
    "- Smooth interaction with the downstream decision-making engine  \n",

    "### **Significance to the CPS Project**\n",
    "\n",
    "The YOLOv11 training pipeline is an essential component of the RPS-1 system. It transforms raw video input into symbolic gesture predictions, enabling the game decision engine to operate on high-confidence inputs. The pipeline demonstrates how modern computer-vision models can be tailored effectively to domain-specific tasks, even with mixed datasets and limited hardware resources.\n",
